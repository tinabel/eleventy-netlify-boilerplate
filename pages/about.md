On an ordinary day you can find me working at Eaton Corporation in Cleveland, Ohio, where I sling code for a living. I’m a CSS geek who enjoys vanilla JavaScript and working on making front-end code as clean as I can.

When I’m not working I enjoy working on my own projects, taking hikes, photography, creating digital art, and cooking. I live in Northeast Ohio with my family.
